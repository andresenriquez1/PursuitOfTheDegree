Pursuit of the Degree, is a game that represents our groups time here at UCLA. We all had a simmlar experience when we first entered Bolter and the Math and Science building, we simply could not navigate the buildings.
Thus, we created a maze like game that has the escence of Bolter and M/S. Additionally, we are being chased by the "EGG", a naotorious difficult but amazing teacher that is known for his
high workload, but also renowned for his abilty to make difficult material understandble. This teacher has many names, one such is the "time lord", however for this game they will be the Egg. Thus 
in this game you will naviagate a maze while being chased by the egg, if you succesfully navigate the maze without capture you earn your degree.
